        Stuffing, a quintessential side dish during festive occasions, is a savory and comforting culinary creation. 
        At its core, stuffing consists of a mixture of seasoned breadcrumbs, herbs, and various ingredients like vegetables, fruits, and nuts. 
        The magic lies in the harmonious blend of flavors and textures, as the bread absorbs the savory juices and aromas during the cooking process. 
        Traditional stuffing recipes often feature ingredients like onions, celery, and herbs such as sage and thyme, contributing layers of earthy and aromatic notes. 
        Whether stuffed inside a turkey for Thanksgiving or baked separately, stuffing serves as a flavorful complement to the main course, adding a rustic and satisfying element to the meal.

        Stuffing isn't just a side dish; it's a canvas for culinary experimentation, adapting to regional tastes and personal preferences. 
        Beyond its role on the holiday table, stuffing embodies the warmth and nostalgia of home-cooked meals, making it a cherished and enduring part of culinary traditions worldwide.

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 loaf of day-old bread (about 10 cups), cut into cubes </li>
        <li> 1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li> 1 large onion, diced </li>
        <li> 2 celery stalks, diced</li>
        <li> 2-3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon dried sage </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon dried thyme </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon dried rosemary </li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon dried parsley </li>
        <li> Salt and black pepper to taste </li>
        <li> 2-3 cups chicken or vegetable broth (amount may vary based on preference and desired moisture level)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Instructions: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> If the bread is not already stale, cut it into small cubes and leave it out overnight to dry. Alternatively, you can toast the cubes in the oven at a low temperature until they are dry but not browned. </li>
        <li> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li> In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add diced onions and celery, cooking until softened, typically for about 5-7 minutes. Add minced garlic and cook for an additional minute. </li>
        <li> Stir in dried sage, thyme, rosemary, parsley, salt, and black pepper. Adjust the seasoning to your taste.</li>
        <li> In a large mixing bowl, combine the dried bread cubes with the sautéed vegetable and herb mixture. Toss well to ensure even coating. </li>
        <li> Gradually add chicken or vegetable broth to the mixture, stirring as you go. The amount of broth needed depends on personal preference and desired moisture level. Start with 2 cups and add more if needed.</li>
        <li> Transfer the stuffing mixture to a greased baking dish, spreading it evenly.</li>
        <li> Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes. Then, uncover and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the top is golden brown.</li>
        <li> Once baked to perfection, remove the stuffing from the oven. Let it rest for a few minutes before serving alongside your favorite holiday meal.</li>
    </ol>
