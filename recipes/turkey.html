    <p> 
        Turkey, a culinary centerpiece synonymous with festive gatherings, boasts a rich tradition steeped in both flavor and symbolism. 
        A perfectly roasted turkey is a triumph in the kitchen, where meticulous preparation and careful cooking elevate it to a succulent masterpiece. 
        The process often begins with a thorough seasoning or brining, imparting depth and moisture to the meat. 
        As the turkey roasts, the kitchen is enveloped in a tantalizing aroma, a prelude to the golden-brown perfection that emerges from the oven. 
        The skin, crispy and crackling, conceals a tender interior that practically melts with each savory bite. 
        The allure of turkey lies not only in its taste but in its ability to bring people together, epitomizing warmth, gratitude, and the shared joy of a communal meal.

        Beyond its role on holiday tables, turkey offers culinary versatility, featuring in sandwiches, stews, and casseroles year-round. 
        Ground turkey becomes a lean substitute in various recipes, showcasing its adaptability in the kitchen. 
        Whether roasted whole for a celebratory feast or creatively incorporated into everyday dishes, turkey holds a special place in the culinary landscape, embodying the spirit of generosity and shared meals that transcends cultural and familial traditions.

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 whole turkey (12-15 pounds) </li>
        <li> 1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li> Salt and black pepper to taste </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon poultry seasoning (optional)</li>
        <li> 1 onion, quartered</li>
        <li> 1 lemon, halved </li>
        <li> 4-5 garlic cloves, crushed </li>
        <li> Fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and sage) </li>
        <li> Chicken or turkey broth for basting </li>

    </ul>
    <h2> Instructions: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat your oven to 325째F (163째C). </li>
        <li> Remove the turkey from its packaging, and pat it dry with paper towels. Place it on a rack inside a roasting pan.</li>
        <li> In a small bowl, mix the softened butter with salt, black pepper, and poultry seasoning (if using). Rub the mixture all over the turkey, including under the skin and in the cavity. </li>
        <li> Stuff the turkey cavity with quartered onions, halved lemon, crushed garlic cloves, and fresh herbs. This not only adds flavor but also contributes to the turkey's aroma.</li>
        <li> If the turkey comes with legs untied, consider tying them together with kitchen twine for more even cooking. </li>
        <li> Place the turkey in the preheated oven. Baste the turkey every 30 minutes with broth to keep it moist. Tent the turkey with foil if the skin is browning too quickly.</li>
        <li> Roast the turkey until the internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C) in the thickest part of the thigh without touching the bone. The total cooking time will depend on the size of the turkey.</li>
        <li> Once done, remove the turkey from the oven and let it rest for at least 20-30 minutes before carving. This allows the juices to redistribute and results in a juicier turkey.</li>
        <li> Carve the turkey into slices, arrange on a platter, and serve with your favorite sides.</li>
    </ol>
